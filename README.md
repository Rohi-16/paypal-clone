⭐**PayPal Clone**
⭐**Production-grade Microservices**

• A 95% realistic PayPal-like payment application implemented using Spring Boot microservices, Kafka, Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker Compose and modern backend tooling.

🚀*Why this project ?*

• Real-world backend architecture: microservices, API Gateway, message-driven design (Kafka), caching (Redis), persistence (Postgres).

• Demonstrates system design, clean API design, security (JWT + RBAC), observability, and Dockerized deployment, all skills hiring teams ask for.

• Good talking points in interviews: design tradeoffs, failure handling, idempotency of transactions, and scaling choices.

🌿**Features:**

•Authentication & Authorization (JWT + Role Based Access Control)

•User service (wallets, KYC placeholders)

•Transaction service (initiate, complete, rollback)

•Notifications service (Kafka-driven)

•Fraud / analytics stubs (design included; extendable)

•API Gateway routing and rate limiting (pattern)

•Docker Compose for local multi-container orchestration

•Test coverage for core transaction flows

•Example CI/CD YAML and infra notes.
